The String is immutable in Java because of the security, synchronization and concurrency, caching, and class loading. 
The reason of making string final is to destroy the immutability and to not allow others to extend it.
 The String objects are cached in the String pool, and it makes the String immutable.

Why string is immutable with example?
In the String constant pool, a String object is likely to have one or many references. 
If several references point to the same String without even knowing it, it would be bad if one of the references modified that String value. 
That's why String objects are immutable.
